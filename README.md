# Request Response NuGet Package

## Description
This is a .NET Core NuGet package designed to [functionality description, e.g., simplify logging, provide data validation, enable custom authentication]. The package offers a streamlined approach for integrating [specific functionality] into .NET Core applications, focusing on performance, scalability, and ease of use.

## Features
- **Feature 1**: [Description of feature 1, e.g., "Seamless integration with ASP.NET Core middleware."]
- **Feature 2**: [Description of feature 2, e.g., "Supports multiple logging targets (file, database, etc.) out of the box."]
- **Feature 3**: [Description of feature 3, e.g., "Customizable settings through configuration files."]
- **Feature 4**: [Description of feature 4, e.g., "Built-in support for dependency injection."]

## Technologies Used
The following technologies and frameworks are utilized within this NuGet package:

- **.NET Core**: Provides a cross-platform foundation for building modern, scalable applications.
- **ASP.NET Core Middleware**: Ensures modular and efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Allows for flexible and maintainable dependency management, making it easier to customize and extend functionalities.
- **Configuration Management**: Using `IConfiguration` from .NET Core, this package offers easy configuration through `appsettings.json`.
- **Logging**: Leveraging `ILogger` for structured, extensible logging to various targets (e.g., file, console, third-party log aggregators).
- **Unit Testing (Optional)**: Includes tests for core functionalities to ensure code quality and stability.
